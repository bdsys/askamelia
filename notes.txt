* Make a CDK app
    - cdk init sample-app --language python

* Write out package requirements
    - requirements.txt in base dir

* activate venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate

* install required packages in venv
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

* app.py is the entry point. It doesn't need to be edited much.

* CDK tool:
    - cdk ls
        - shows app in directory with cdk.json file
    - cdk bootstrap
        - Builds required AWS resources into account the first time CDK is used
            to build a project in said account.
    - cdk synth
        - Synthesizes CFN stack based on CDK project
    - cdk diff
        - Shows the difference between CDK project and deployed resources
    - cdk deploy
        - Deploys the synthesized CFN stack from "cdk synth"
    - cdk deploy --hotswap
        - Used in development to quickly deploy Lambda code changes by
            deliberately introducing drift to generate a change.
    - cdk watch
        - Watches CDK resource and lambda code files for changes. Deploys a
            hotswap style deployment upon qualified change.
            Can be controlled in cdk.json file, which controls which files are
            considered for deploy qualification relative to the location of
            cdk.json.
    - cdk watch --no-hotswap
        - since cdk watch uses hotswap style deployments by default, you must
            specify no hotswap to change the deploy qualification behavior.
    - cdk destroy
        - Destroys the CDK stack. Not the bootstrap.

* Bootstrap AWS account with CDK resources
    - cdk bootstrap
    
* Note on Lambda functions in CDK:
    - The handler code is loaded from the "<cdk_folder>/lambda/" relative to 
        where you execute cdk from, which is the project’s root directory.

* CDK constructs
    - Cloud components used together to make the CDK app's resources
    - Construct disection of inputs: (scope, id, **kwargs)
        - scope: Constructs are always in the context (scope) of another
            construct.
        This can be itself (self) or another construct.
        - id: CDK uses the Id as a unique value to create a cloudformation id.
        - **kwargs: Sometimes optional wildcard inputs used to control parts
            of the construct (E.g. runtime, code, handler, etc.)

* Added the following value to the context hash table in cdk.json to correct permissions issues:
    - "@aws-cdk/core:newStyleStackSynthesis": true,
